### - Answer Question Alert

- To complete the quiz, the user must fill in all the answers. if not, an alert will pop up telling them to fill in 
and answers thta ave been left blank. This is to allow the user to get the top score they can. All questions are multiple choice with 4 selections available, meaining even if they are not sure, they will still have a 25% chance of success  

### - scrolable questions

- Having to scroll to reach the next queston means that the user is prompted to take each question in turn, before moving immediately ont the later questions. Tis helps to prevent questions from being left out by accident. 

### - score

- When submit button is pressed, score is gathered and posted as an alert for the user to see.

### - revealing correct answers 
- when initially making the web page, i made it so that when the user pressed reveal answers, all answers were shown. this amde it much too easy to get 100% on the quiz. 
- now, when submitting answers and the score is shown, the questions tht are answereed incorrect are also shown but the answers to the questions answered incorrect are nit revealed.   

### - Future Additions to the Website
- in the future i would like to add a sign up section, where the user can enter a username into the quiz, and score is displayed on the alert with the username. 

## - Testing
- rewrote javascript to make code more readable and concise
- Website was tested on Safari and Chrome and ran with no issues 
- each question was tested to see if the score worked aswell as the answer button alert 
- page was tested using dev tools to make sure that it was suitable for all screen sizes
